     * A small frog wants to get to the other side of the road. The frog is currently located at position X and wants to get to a position greater than or equal to Y. The small frog always jumps a fixed distance, D.
     Count the minimal number of jumps that the small frog must perform to reach its target.
     Write a function:
     class Solution { public int solution(int X, int Y, int D); }
     that, given three integers X, Y and D, returns the minimal number of jumps from position X to a position equal to or greater than Y.
     For example, given:
     X = 10
     Y = 85
     D = 30
     the function should return 3, because the frog will be positioned as follows:
     after the first jump, at position 10 + 30 = 40
     after the second jump, at position 10 + 30 + 30 = 70
     after the third jump, at position 10 + 30 + 30 + 30 = 100
     Assume that:
     X, Y and D are integers within the range [1..1,000,000,000];
     X â‰¤ Y.
     Complexity:
     expected worst-case time complexity is O(1);
     expected worst-case space complexity is O(1).
